This Privacy Policy Notice explains the way your personal information is collected and used. If you
choose to use our app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with
this policy.

## Collection of Routine Information

We do not require a sign in to use this app.

This app does track basic information about our users and app activity. Specifically, we use
[Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11593727) to track various
information, including, but not limited to: the number of users, session statistics, approximate 
geolocation, and device information. We might also collect app events, for example, reading from
and writing to a BLE Characteristic. Only UUIDs are collected, and we do not collect any BLE data
that is read from or written to a device.

The information is tracked for routine administration, bug tracking, and maintenance purposes.

## Cookies

Where necessary, this app uses cookies to store information about a user’s
preferences and history in order to better serve the user and/or present
the user with customized content. Refer to
[Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11593727) for more information.

## Advertisement and Other Third Parties

Advertising partners and other third parties may use cookies, scripts and/or web beacons to
track user activities on this app in order to display
advertisements and other useful information. Such tracking is done directly by the third parties
through their own servers and is subject to their own privacy policies. This app
has no access or control over these cookies, scripts and/or web beacons that may be used by third
parties. Learn how to [opt out of Google’s cookie usage](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no
method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

identifiable information from children under 13.
