# Jetpack Compose BLE Scanner with Room, Koin, and JUnit 5

Scan your BLE devices with my new Jetpack Compose app. BLE scans include:

* The device name, if known
* The MAC address
* A list of advertised services
* Manufacturer specific data, when possible
* and a timestamp of when the device was last seen

Includes partial support for [Microsoft Beacon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-cdp/77b446d0-8cea-4821-ad21-fabdf4d9a569).
